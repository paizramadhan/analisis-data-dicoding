# Air Quality Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project provides an interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit** to analyze air quality data from two stations, **Aotizhongxin** and **Changping**. The analysis focuses on pollution levels, particularly **PM2.5** and **PM10**, across different seasons, months, and times of day, and investigates how weather conditions correlate with pollution. The dashboard enables users to explore the data through visualizations and draw key insights about air quality trends.

## Features

1. **Pollutant Distribution**: Displays histograms of various pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) with density curves to show the distribution of pollution levels.
   
2. **PM2.5 and PM10 Trends**: 
   - **Time Series Plots** showing the variation of **PM2.5** and **PM10** levels over time for each station.
   - **Average Monthly Trends** to visualize seasonal changes and identify the months with peak or low pollution levels.
   
3. **Seasonal Analysis**:
   - **Bar Plots** highlighting average PM2.5 and PM10 levels across different seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) for both stations.
   
4. **Correlation Analysis**: A **heatmap** displaying the correlations between weather variables (temperature, wind speed, pressure) and pollution levels (PM2.5 and PM10). 

5. **Data Summary**: Provides descriptive statistics for the selected stations, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, giving an overview of the dataset.

6. **Interactive Filtering**: Allows users to select the station(s) they want to analyze, making the dashboard more flexible.

## Data

The data consists of air quality measurements taken from two stations:
- **Aotizhongxin**
- **Changping**

The key variables include:
- **Pollutants**: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, Wind Speed, Pressure
- **Date and Time Information**: Year, Month, Day, Hour

## Installation

### Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Streamlit
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Pandas
6. Numpy

You can install the necessary Python packages by running:

\`\`\`bash
pip install streamlit matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
\`\`\`

### Running the Dashboard

1. Clone this repository or download the script files.
2. Run the following command to start the Streamlit application:

\`\`\`bash
streamlit run air_quality_dashboard.py
\`\`\`

3. Upload the air quality datasets (CSV files) for **Aotizhongxin** and **Changping** when prompted in the sidebar.

## Visualizations and Insights

### 1. Pollutant Distributions
Histograms for pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3** are displayed to show the spread and frequency of pollution levels.

### 2. Time Series Analysis
- **PM2.5 and PM10 Variation over Time**: Visualizes how pollution levels change over time across both stations, helping identify trends such as spikes or reductions.

### 3. Monthly and Seasonal Trends
- **Average Monthly Trends**: Line plots showing how PM2.5 and PM10 levels change each month, highlighting when pollution peaks (typically in the winter months).
- **Seasonal Analysis**: Bar charts showing the average pollution levels for each season, comparing **Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall**. 

### 4. Correlation Heatmap
- The heatmap shows the correlation between weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, pressure) and pollution levels, indicating factors that influence air quality (e.g., wind speed is negatively correlated with pollution).

### 5. Key Insights and Conclusion
The dashboard concludes with key findings:
- Pollution levels peak in the **Winter** (December and January).
- Higher wind speeds correlate with lower pollution levels.
- The **Winter season** consistently shows the highest levels of PM2.5 and PM10, while **Summer** has the lowest.
- Further analysis can be done by linking pollution reductions to **holidays** or **regulations**.

## Future Improvements
- Include more weather variables for correlation analysis.
- Allow for real-time data updates.
- Add more stations or geographic locations for a wider analysis.
- Investigate external factors such as **government regulations** or **events** that might impact pollution levels.
